Ah, brave reader, you’ve uncovered the spellbook known as node1.xml, an AutoYaST profile so mighty it conjures fully prepared openSUSE servers with a single incantation. But beware: this isn’t your average “next-next-finish” setup. Nay, this is infrastructure-as-sorcery, and with great power comes great responsibility… and the occasional bootloader curse. Let's break down the key artifacts inside this XML grimoire so you can tweak it for your own arcane hardware.

## Identity of the Node

```xml
<hostname>node1</hostname>
<ipaddr>192.168.69.20</ipaddr>
```

The node is christened node1, with a noble IP of 192.168.69.20. You'll want to change both if you're casting this spell on multiple machines—unless you're going for a "fight club cluster" where all nodes share the same name and IP (spoiler: don't). The DNS nameserver and gateway are set to 192.168.69.254, so unless your network speaks the same incantation, update these accordingly.

## Disk Magic and Partition Runes

```xml
<hostname>node1</hostname>
<ipaddr>192.168.69.20</ipaddr>
```

This profile assumes you’re booting from /dev/vda (virtio disk, commonly used in VMs). If you’re deploying on physical metal or using different devices (like /dev/sda or NVMe /dev/nvme0n1), update the device paths, or AutoYaST will just stare blankly into the void and reboot repeatedly.

Partitioning is gloriously specific—each mount point has its own logical volume. You’ll find:

    / — the root, because obviously

    /var/lib/rancher — prepped for K3s or RKE2 shenanigans

    /var/lib/longhorn — for when you summon distributed storage demons

    /tmp, /var/tmp, /usr, /home — all separated for containment and arcane security rituals

⚠️ You’ll likely need to adjust the disk sizes (<size>) depending on your available storage. The "max" value is used cleverly for Longhorn, because block storage demands sacrifices.

## Software Arsenal

```xml
<package>helm</package>
<package>mc</package>
<package>htop</package>
<package>iptables</package>
```

This loadout includes the essential tools of any system sorcerer: helm, mc, htop, and even which (for those who don’t know where they’ve hidden their own binaries). You may want to add packages like git, curl, gnupg, or even the mighty k3s binary itself—unless you’re planning to summon it over the network later (as you should).
