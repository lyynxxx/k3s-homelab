Ah, brave reader, you‚Äôve uncovered the spellbook known as node1.xml, an AutoYaST profile so mighty it conjures fully prepared openSUSE servers with a single incantation. But beware: this isn‚Äôt your average ‚Äúnext-next-finish‚Äù setup. Nay, this is infrastructure-as-sorcery, and with great power comes great responsibility‚Ä¶ and the occasional bootloader curse. Let's break down the key artifacts inside this XML grimoire so you can tweak it for your own arcane hardware.

## Identity of the Node

```xml
<hostname>node1</hostname>
<ipaddr>192.168.69.20</ipaddr>
```

The node is christened node1, with a noble IP of 192.168.69.20. You'll want to change both if you're casting this spell on multiple machines‚Äîunless you're going for a "fight club cluster" where all nodes share the same name and IP (spoiler: don't). The DNS nameserver and gateway are set to 192.168.69.254, so unless your network speaks the same incantation, update these accordingly.

## Disk Magic and Partition Runes

```xml
<hostname>node1</hostname>
<ipaddr>192.168.69.20</ipaddr>
```

This profile assumes you‚Äôre booting from /dev/vda (virtio disk, commonly used in VMs). If you‚Äôre deploying on physical metal or using different devices (like /dev/sda or NVMe /dev/nvme0n1), update the device paths, or AutoYaST will just stare blankly into the void and reboot repeatedly.

Partitioning is gloriously specific‚Äîeach mount point has its own logical volume. You‚Äôll find:

    / ‚Äî the root, because obviously

    /var/lib/rancher ‚Äî prepped for K3s or RKE2 shenanigans

    /var/lib/longhorn ‚Äî for when you summon distributed storage demons

    /tmp, /var/tmp, /usr, /home ‚Äî all separated for containment and arcane security rituals

‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôll likely need to adjust the disk sizes (<size>) depending on your available storage. The "max" value is used cleverly for Longhorn, because block storage demands sacrifices.

## Software Arsenal

```xml
<package>helm</package>
<package>mc</package>
<package>htop</package>
<package>iptables</package>
```

This loadout includes the essential tools of any system sorcerer: helm, mc, htop, and even which (for those who don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôve hidden their own binaries). You may want to add packages like git, curl, gnupg, or even the mighty k3s binary itself‚Äîunless you‚Äôre planning to summon it over the network later (as you should).

## Services and Daemons

```xml
<disable><service>firewalld</service></disable>
<enable><service>sshd</service></enable>
```

You‚Äôll notice we slay firewalld right away, because in a homelab, the real firewall is a router under your desk (also I have static nftables rules...). SSH is enabled for remote wizardry, and chronyd syncs time so your certificates don‚Äôt mysteriously expire five seconds after boot. Again, tune this list if your rituals require other daemons.

## Secrets and Security

```xml
<username>root</username>
<user_password>changeit</user_password>
<encrypted>false</encrypted>
```

Let‚Äôs not pretend this isn‚Äôt sketchy. The root password is in plain text and set to changeit, which is security code for ‚Äúplease breach me immediately.‚Äù You must change this before sharing, syncing, or pushing this file anywhere outside your batcave. Better yet, encrypt the password and set encrypted=true.


## What You Should Modify For Your Own Nodes

| üîÆ Element      | Why You Care                         | Change It To...                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `hostname`      | Unique identity per node             | `node2`, `node3`, etc.                 |
| `ipaddr`        | Static IP per machine                | According to your own network plan     |
| `/dev/vda`      | Disk device path                     | `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1`, etc.       |
| Partition sizes | Your disk probably isn‚Äôt *just* 40GB | Increase depending on workload/storage |
| `user_password` | Default root password, in plain text | At least encrypt it!                   |
| Repos/URLs      | openSUSE Leap 15.6 default           | Check mirror speed / custom repos      |


## Final Words of Wizardry

This AutoYaST profile is your golden scroll: repeatable, reliable, and terrifyingly powerful. With it, you can boot metal into ready-to-work linux nodes faster than most people find their terminal icon. Just remember: tweak before you cast. Unless you like wiping disks and debugging network configs at 3am while whispering ‚Äúit worked on the last node‚Ä¶‚Äù


## Neat! But... how to use it?

To begin the ritual, you‚Äôll need to summon the openSUSE Leap 15.6 installation ISO from https://get.opensuse.org/leap/15.6/ (as of writing these lines... may there is a newer version, when you read this)  
Use the Network Image if you prefer minimal boot clutter and faster downloads. Burn it to a USB stick or mount it as a virtual CD in your favorite hypervisor (KVM, VirtualBox, Proxmox ‚Äî pick your poison). Boot your machine or VM with the ISO, and prepare to feed it the AutoYaST file like a config-hungry beast. Also, you need a web server, to host the xml file.
